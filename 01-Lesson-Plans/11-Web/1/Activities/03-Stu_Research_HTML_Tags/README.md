### Instructions

* In Breakout rooms, together everyone write a list of as many html elements you can come up with in 10 minutes.

* Write the tag in html and add a comment underneath with its description (create a comment by typing `ctrl /` for PC or `command /` for Mac).

  * Identify which elements are void elements (self-closing), and which are not.

* This list should be a combination of elements we've gone over already and some new elements we haven't yet discussed.

* Whatever team gets the most amount of elements wins a cookie or Gretel's undying respect.

* After you are done, have one person slack out the html document to the rest of the class.
