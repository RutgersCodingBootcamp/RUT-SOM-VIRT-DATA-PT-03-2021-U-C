## Career Services

Remind the students to review the Career Connection document in the [04-Career-Modules](../../04-Career-Modules/) folder. It ties what we do in the classroom to the profession and includes technical interviewing practice.

**Important:** If you haven't already done so, remember to push this entire folder for the students to access.

If you'd like more information about Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](http://bit.ly/DataVizCS).
