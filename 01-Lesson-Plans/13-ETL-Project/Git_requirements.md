For this project, your GitHub repository must look professional and ready for a potential employer to see it. You should be proud of your repository. For this reason, there will be requirements on how you manage your GitHub repository.

* It is mandatory that you meet the following GitHub requirements for the ETL project. A full letter grade (10 out of 100 points) will be based on correctly using GitHub and your git workflow. 
* You may use either the command line or GitHub desktop as long as the requirements are fulfilled.
* Every single one of the following items has been covered previously. I have provided a cheatsheet and a workflow document created for project 1.

**Please note: these requirements are independent of the requirements for your README**


## Requirements
1. All members must have at least 10 coding commits. This means that changes to the README do not count towards the 10. 
  * The entire team will lose points if **any** member does not meet this requirement. 
  * If you have concerns about a fellow team member, please contact a member of the instructional team.
2. When you submit, you must not have any extra unnecessary files, especially junk files (e.g., .DS_Store, notebook checkpoints, any file you didn't use).
3. All files must have consistent naming conventions and the names must be meaningful.
4. Your files must be organized in a logical way, utilizing folders when appropriate.
  * For example, you must not have one .csv in a folder called "data" and another .csv in a folder called "resources."
  
5.  You can have multiple notebooks; however, the reason for the different notebooks must make sense and must, again, be named appropriately.
  * For example, it doesn't make sense to clean a single .csv in two different notebooks.

6. Every branch must have a name related to the feature it addresses. **It is unacceptable to have a branch that is solely your name.** 
  * You may use initials to indicate who is primarily working on a branch, but just because someone created a branch does not mean that someone else cannot work on the same branch.
7. Commit messages must be *meaningful*. It is perfectly acceptable to have a longer commit message by not using the `-m` flag in the CLI. If you have questions on how to do this, please speak to Gretel.
  * Example of a meaningful commit message: "Clean csv by removing unnecessary columns and casting data types"
  * Examples of bad commit messages: "Clean csv" or "Gretel update" or "Second commit"
7. **New**: Branches must be deleted after they are merged to `main`.
