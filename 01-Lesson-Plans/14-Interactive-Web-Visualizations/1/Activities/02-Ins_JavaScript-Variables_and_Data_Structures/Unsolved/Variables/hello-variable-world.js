// JavaScript Variables work a lot like Python variables, but they should be initialized with the `let` keyword.

// variables in JavaScript can be assigned string values...


// ...boolean values...


// ...numerical values...


// ...or expressions using other variables.


console.log('Hello JavaScript World!')
console.log('We use console.log() to print in JavaScript')
console.log('Why? Because the print() function will try to send the page to your printer!')
console.log(`Did you know that ${name} is ${age} years old and makes $${weeklyWage} per week?`)
// we can also define constant variables with the `const` keyword. This tells JavaScript that the variable can't
// be assigned a new value

console.log(`The value of pi is approximately ${pi}, and always will be!`)

// reassigning will give an Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

// JavaScript Objects work a lot like Python dictionaries


// JavaScript Arrays are a lot like Python lists
